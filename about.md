I'm Vlad and I try to be a good person and a good software engineer.

I grew up in Romania, became an adult in Ireland and had my epiphanies travelling.

I worked at Microsoft for nearly 10 years, built great software together with amazing people and learned a lot along the way, from successes and mistakes alike.

I believe the only way to know if your ideas are any good is to let them out of your head. I will always try to support anything I post with evidence and/or arguments, but do keep in mind that at the end of the day mine is just another opinion on the internet. Please use your better judgement and engage constructively. I decline liability for absolutely everything that you might conceive to consider me liable for.

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
